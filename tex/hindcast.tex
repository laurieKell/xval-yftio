When inspecting residuals there is a danger of hypothesis fishing and if multiple true hypotheses are tested it is likely that some of them will be rejected. Therefore it is valuable to reserve part of the data for validation, so that a patternâ€™s significance is not tested on the same data set which suggested the pattern.
